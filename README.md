# loopback-connector-memcached
Loopback connector for Memcached. This is currently work in progress, however, it is functional. 

## Used similar to how built in connectors would be used, however, the API may be different with respect to the operations that the Memcached provides. A operation like findAll would be reasonable in the context of Memcached, for example.
